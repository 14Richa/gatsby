How has August been for all of you? It's been rainy here in Mumbai. Like [_really_](https://qz.com/india/1703369/photos-of-mumbai-rains-and-floods-amid-indian-monsoons/) rainy. But let's not digress cause it's time for the Gatsby Gazette!

(I need to get better at rhyming)

This instalment features our work on materialisation, a healthier Gatsby repo with improved community engagement, better webpack chunking, a brand new Gatsby theme of the month and finally, Gatsby Days!

Let's get this party started.

## Gatsby Site of the month

Brand new month, brand new Gatsby site.

The site of the month is [ghost.org](https://ghost.org)

They built a brand new Gatsby site and we love it because:

- Beautiful colours
- That video in the home page background
- Blazing fast navigation thanks to Gatsby

## Theme of the Month

The Gatsby theme of the month is [Novela (a theme by Narative)](https://github.com/narative/gatsby-theme-novela)

With minimal styling and maximum features â€” including multiple homepage layouts, built-in social sharing and dark mode â€” Novela makes it easy to start publishing beautiful articles and stories with Gatsby.

I'm a big fan of the team at Narative and think Novela shows off some of the best part of Gatsby themes.

Here is what [Dennis Brotzky](https://twitter.com/_brotzky) (Co-founder, [narative.co](https://www.narative.co/)) had to say:

> Weâ€™ve always enjoyed using Gatsby for our projects and when themes were announcement we knew it would be special. Novela is our first dive into themes and weâ€™ve quickly grown to love it. Itâ€™s exciting to be part of the formation of a new way to build and share Gatsby sites.

## Gatsby Days, London

The entire Gatsby team is headed to London in a few weeks for our quarterly Gatsby gathering!

And with that, comes the next Gatsby Days. If you haven't registered already, please do [here](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/resources/gatsby-days/) to watch the Gatsby team and friends talk about exciting new things in the Gatsby world.

We'd love to meet you ðŸ’œ
