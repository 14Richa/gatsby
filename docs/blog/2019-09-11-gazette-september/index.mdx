How was August for all of you? It's been rainy here in Mumbai. Like [_really_](https://qz.com/india/1703369/photos-of-mumbai-rains-and-floods-amid-indian-monsoons/) rainy. But let's not digress cause it's time for the Gatsby Gazette!

(I need to get better at rhyming)

This month's gazette features our work on materialization, a healthier Gatsby repo with improved community engagement, some accessibility wins, better webpack chunking, a better offline experience in Gatsby, a brand new theme of the month, and finally, Gatsby Days!

Let's get this party started.

## Team Highlights

The Gatsby team has had a busy month. We've made some exciting improvements.

### Accessibility

Marcy Sutton from Gatsby's learning team has been doing some incredible work in making Gatsby more accessible by default. A big part of making the web more accessible is teaching us to write more accessible apps! Back in June, Marcy conducted some user testing sessions for accessibility research. She wrote about it in her post, [What we learned from user testing of accessible client-side routing techniques with Fable Tech Labs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/blog/2019-07-11-user-testing-accessible-client-routing/) which I consider canonical and required reading. 

Marcy also presented a full-length workshop on [Accessibility in JavaScript Applications for Frontend Masters](https://frontendmasters.com/workshops/javascript-accessibility/), including some exclusive tidbits about building accessible Gatsby sites. In case you haven't read her post or seen her workshop already, please _do_ to learn how to make your web apps more accessible.

Here is what Marcy had to say about her work:

## Community Highlights

It's been a pretty busy month on the monorepo. We've merged in a _lot_ of your contributions and they've all been amazing. Let's go over some of the highlights!

### GraphiQL Code Explorer

Back in June, Michal from the Gatsby core team worked on adding [GraphiQL Explorer](https://github.com/OneGraph/graphiql-explorer) to GraphiQL in Gatsby. One of the next steps he mentioned was the addition of code snippet generation using graphiql-code-exporter.

Gatsby now includes Code Explorer in GraphiQL out of the box starting from v2.15.3, thanks to [Dan Kirkham](https://twitter.com/herecydev).

When you write a query in GraphiQL, this will automatically generate code for you! You can check out Dan's work on [the PR on GitHub](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/pull/17120).

### Notable PRs

It's _really_ hard to pick out favourites from all the incredible contributions you folks make so apologies in advance if I missed anything (let [us](https://twitter.com/gatsbyjs) know on Twitter). Here are my favourites from the past month:

- [Jeremy Albright](https://github.com/Js-Brecht) did some really solid work and fixed an issue where Gatsby CLI would leave your terminal in an inconsistent state in [#16714](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/pull/16714)
- [Nicolas Goutay](https://github.com/phacks) fixed a memory leak in IntersectionObservers (with help from [atomiks](https://github.com/atomiks)) in [#17056](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/pull/17056)
- [Benedikt Franke](https://github.com/spawnia) brought order to some chaos by making root plural fields non nullable in [#15321](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/pull/15321)
- [Mateusz BurzyÅ„ski](https://github.com/Andarist) cleaned up several significant parts of Gatsby by refactoring some code paths over to XState in [#17192](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/pull/17192)
- [Matthew Miller](https://github.com/me4502) fixed an issue that could cause infinite loops in cyclic node trees in [#17078](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/pull/17078)

## Gatsby Site of the month

Brand new month, brand new Gatsby site.

The site of the month is [ghost.org](https://ghost.org)

They built their brand new site in Gatsby and we love it because:

- That video in the home page background
- Nice little animations
- Blazing fast navigation thanks to Gatsby

## Theme of the Month

The Gatsby theme of the month is [Novela (a theme by Narative)](https://github.com/narative/gatsby-theme-novela)

![Novela (a Gatsby theme by Narative)](./gatsby-theme-novela-hero.jpg)

With minimal styling and maximum features â€” including multiple homepage layouts, built-in social sharing and dark mode â€” Novela makes it easy to start publishing beautiful articles and stories with Gatsby.

I'm a big fan of the team at Narative and think Novela shows off some of the best part of Gatsby themes.

Here is what [Dennis Brotzky](https://twitter.com/_brotzky) (Co-founder, [narative.co](https://www.narative.co/)) had to say:

> Weâ€™ve always enjoyed using Gatsby for our projects and when themes were announcement we knew it would be special. Novela is our first dive into themes and weâ€™ve quickly grown to love it. Itâ€™s exciting to be part of the formation of a new way to build and share Gatsby sites.

## Gatsby Days, London

The entire Gatsby team is headed to London in a few weeks for our quarterly Gatsby gathering!

And with that, comes the next Gatsby Days. If you haven't registered already, please do [here](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/resources/gatsby-days/) to watch the Gatsby team and friends talk about exciting new things in the Gatsby world.
