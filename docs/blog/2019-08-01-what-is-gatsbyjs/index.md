A seemingly simple question. But the best answer depends on who you're talking to!

Gatsby originally grew out of the desire to combine the developer workflow of using React.js with the benefits of static site generation. At the time, it was natural to catalogue Gatsby as a static site generator -- it does produce static assets.

But crucially, there's more to the story; Gatsby combines the web app and website paradigms, combining the best from static site generation, agnostic data sourcing, and the single page app experience.

## What is GatsbyJS: For Developers

<Pullquote>
Gatsby is a free, open-source, React-based framework for building fast websites and applications. Gatsby streamlines the setup and configuration of your build, it can pull data into your UI from any and all of your sources, and amazing performance and current web best practices are built into Gatsby sites.
</Pullquote>

### Key features

- **Site speed:** Gatsby was built with performance in mind from its inception. Gatsby’s automated performance optimizations include pre-fetching resources, code splitting, statically generating HTML, and Google’s PRPL Pattern.

- **Modern web tools:** Gatsby sites are built with React - currently the most popular framework for developing web apps, and data can be pulled into your React components via GraphQL. Gatsby is also built to pull data from any source so you can pick the best tool for each job and function your site needs to perform. Pull data from the best content management tools, the best e-commerce tools, whatever databases you’re using, and more.

- **Plugins and features:** Just about every feature you could want for building a state-of-the-art website or web app is available through Gatsby. If the feature isn’t already built in, there’s an extensive library of available plugins.

- **Community and documentation:** The Gatsby open-source community is highly active and welcoming. The Gatsby team is committed to transparency and working in the open so the community can follow and participate in Gatsby’s development and direction. Everyone is encouraged to contribute to Gatsby and every contribution is valued. Documentation is thorough, detailed, and doesn’t make any assumptions about your experience-level going in.

- **Brings focus to the front end:** Complicated tooling and configuration can consume a lot of development time and can pull front-end developers away from doing what they do best. Because Gatsby requires minimal tooling and configuration, front-end developers can spend more time making great UIs.

### Key Features

- **Performance:** Gatsby sites are consistently 2-3x faster than similar sites built with other tools, with pages loading in milliseconds rather than seconds. Gatsby’s automated performance optimizations include pre-fetching resources, code splitting, progressive image loading, statically generating HTML, and Google’s PRPL Pattern.

- **Security:** Gatsby outputs static HTML pages at build time, which means you don’t need a database or content management system running on your public servers, both of which are common sources of security breaches. Static content is much easier to secure. (_This does not, by any means, eliminate all security vulnerabilities for Gatsby sites, but they will be significantly reduced._)

- **Scalability:** The scalability of your traffic handling, product complexity and features, and your development process will all benefit from Gatsby. Gatsby sites can be entirely deployed to a CDN, effectively eliminating your risk of downtime due to traffic spikes. If your site or application needs to support new functionality, Gatsby can pull content from as many sources as you need. Gatsby equips dev teams to make their own components that can be reused across projects with minimal reworking, giving them more time to work on new features.

- **Lower costs:** CDN hosting for static sites is much, much less expensive than traditional hosting costs, reducing your digital total cost of ownership. You’ll also save money on team resources as your developers will spend much less time working on performance optimization and configuring integrations.

## What is GatsbyJS: For Marketers

Over 50% of people will abandon a site if it takes more than 3 seconds to load. This translates directly into lost revenue, decreased lead conversion, and a poor user experience. Get the most out of your website with a site that’s blazing fast and optimized for SEO, lead conversion, and revenue generation. Gatsby is the modern way to build reliable, lightning fast websites and apps.

### Key Features

- **Site speed:** Think rocket ship vs. sea turtle. Gatsby takes fast to a whole new level with websites that are pre-built and live on the edge—right where your customers are. Pages load in milliseconds rather than seconds. Gatsby enables teams to create lightning-fast, content-driven websites without needing to become performance experts.

- **SEO Optimized:** Think of all the time a team spends on creating compelling, optimized content just to have the search ranking penalized by a slow website. A Search Engine Optimized website means a higher organic search ranking and more website traffic, which can mean more leads and revenue. Get as much out of your website as you do your content and see the impact.

- **Optimized for Lead Conversion:** For every second it takes a page to load, the bounce rate increases and the lead conversion drops. For e-commerce sites, some estimates say you may lose up to 1% in revenue for every 100ms delay in page load time. The longer it takes a page to load, the more customers/leads/revenue you lose. Get greater lead conversion with a fast website that loads on even slow connections.

- **Generating Revenue:** Generating revenue with your website is especially important for e-commerce sites. If an e-commerce company doesn’t get a high enough ROI (return on investment), then they may be out of business in a few months. Even just a one second improvement in page load time can increase revenue by 7%. The less time it takes a page to load, the more money you make.

## What is GatsbyJS: For Executives

Gatsby is a new way to build websites and applications with exceptional performance, reduced risk of downtime, fewer security vulnerabilities, and the flexibility to work with the best tools for your business. Companies that have moved their sites to Gatsby have seen significant improvements in their lead conversion, organic search traffic, and team productivity.

### Key Features

- **Better lead generation and customer engagement:** Site speed and performance has a huge impact on sales and customer engagement. A recent Akamai study showed that a 100 millisecond delay in a site’s load time hurt conversion rates by 7%, and 53% of mobile users will leave pages that take more than 3 seconds to load. Gatsby sites are consistently 2-3x faster than similar sites built with different tools, and site owners have seen their lead generation increase by up to 60% after transitioning to Gatsby.

- **Improved Search Traffic:** Site speed is one of the factors Google uses in its search ranking algorithm, and slow site speeds can have a negative snowball effect on your SEO. Slower sites take longer to be crawled and indexed by search engines, they have higher bounce rates, and lower conversion rates, all of which will hurt your rankings. Gatsby sites have built-in web and mobile performance optimizations.

- **Increase productivity:** Gatsby makes you productive right from the start. It takes away the overhead of time-consuming dev and build tooling setup and configuration which leads to faster iteration. Without the burden of complicated tooling, your development team is more focused, more productive, and more satisfied with their work.

- **Lower costs:** Gatsby sites consist of static assets, which can be entirely deployed to a CDN -- which is much less expensive than traditional hosting costs. Plus, CDN hosting basically eliminates your risk of downtime during traffic spikes so you don’t miss out on those lead-conversion opportunities. Finally, Gatsby is open source, so you’re also saving on software licensing costs.

- **Keep your applications ahead of the curve:** Gatsby is one of the technologies at the forefront of a new approach to web and application development known as the JAMStack. The JAMStack represents a shift away from the limitations of CMS-centered sites and failure points of server-side code towards faster, light-weight, modular site construction. The JAMStack approach and Gatsby have been rapidly gaining popularity in the last few years with no sign of slowing down.

### Key Features

- **Bring your own CMS:** Comfort with a content workflow is an important concern for clients. Content creators often don't want to deal with code, they want a process optimized for drafting content. With Gatsby, you can source data from a CMS of your choice, whether that's an already-familiar CMS, or a new one that's ideally suited for your team.

- **Fast development ensures timely delivery:** A Gatsby workflow makes teams productive from the start, and allows teams to build rapidly and deliver faster.

- **Ease of making development changes:** Because you're not restricted to a monolithic CMS, as requirements change, it's easier for teams to pivot and make development changes. The Gatsby workflow optimizes for using the best service for the job, which empowers teams be more fleet-footed.

- **Competitive bids, and delivering under budget:** Agencies that are shipping Gatsby sites report that they have a competitive advantage on bids. Because teams can build faster and more efficiently with Gatsby, their bids come in lower than competitors.

- **Lower long-term cost of maintenance:** Because a Gatsby site can be hosted as static files, it's much cheaper to host, dramatically lowering the traditional cost of website hosting.
